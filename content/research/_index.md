   *Applied Economics Letters (2024). Available at: https://doi.org/10.1080/13504851.2024.2386145*.  
   **Abstract:** We investigate the impact of the Berlin Wall's fall on West Berliners' salaries using the Synthetic Control Method and regional-level data (NUTS-2) from the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). Our study shows that the collapse of the Berlin Wall led to a sudden stagnation in salaries for West Berliners, compared to a scenario where the Wall had remained intact.

1. **Maurerer, I.; Puy, M.; Urzay-Gómez, S. (2024). "Explaining Preferences for EU Integration: Theory and Empirical Evidence"**  
   *Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=4812690*. **R&R in European Economic Review**.
   **Abstract:** We present a theoretical framework that explains how European citizens form their preferences on EU integration, which is a crucial aspect to understand the public support for the EU advancement. Building on the theories of nation formation, we consider three distinct ideological cost functions measuring the impact of EU legislation on national politics. These cost functions are categorized by degrees of sophistication, ranging from low to high. Low sophistication assumes that the EU defines an ideological direction (left or right) for member states. High sophistication assumes that EU legislation is combined with national legislation and directly impacts national policies. Individual-level survey data from EU member states are analyzed to test which degree of sophistication best predicts integration preferences. The empirical results show that European citizens tend to be highly sophisticated, implying that the advancement of EU integration is supported by citizens who believe the EU legislation amends their national policy; by contrast, Euroscepticism emerges among citizens who believe that the EU interferes with national policy.

   *Submitted*. *Available at SSRN: https://ssrn.com/abstract=5120572*.
   **Abstract:** This study examines the relationship between firms’ market power, captured by product markups and labor markdowns, and the labor share within European Union firms. Using firm-level data from the CompNet database, we develop a micro-econometric framework linking the labor share to firms’ market power. Empirical results show that labor markdowns reduce the labor share, while product markups have a hump-shaped impact on it. This occurs because firms with high pricing power tend to exercise increasing monopsony power over their workers, thereby reducing labor costs. The analysis also reveals significant cross-country heterogeneity in the link between markups, markdowns, and labor share.

**CURRENT RESEARCH**

1. **Urzay-Gómez, S. (2024a). "PIGS in Crisis: Euro Preference, Age, and Education"**  
   *Mimeo UdG*.
   **Abstract:** This study analyses how the financial crisis has affected the preference for the euro in the PIGS countries. Using biannual Eurobarometer survey data from 1999 to 2019 and a two-level random intercept logistic model, the results show that during the crisis, support for the euro declined throughout the area. In particular, on the one hand those who are less educated showed a significant decreasing preference towards the euro, whereas on the other hand younger cohorts exhibit a stronger preference for the euro, contrasting with older generations.

2. **Urzay-Gómez, S. (2024b). "Wages at the Edge: Analysing EU 2004 Enlargement in Germany's Border"**  
   *Mimeo UdG*.  
   **Abstract:** This study examines how the 2004 enlargement of the European Union has affected salaries in German border regions, using individual-level data from the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). Applying a Difference-in-Differences approach, we examine the financial effects on citizens residing close to Poland and the Czech Republic. According to our research, salaries have decreased after expansion, underscoring the complex difficulties associated with economic integration. Additionally, the analysis revealed a more pronounced adverse effect in the districts of former East Germany. This study contributes a fresh viewpoint to the body of literature on EU enlargement by concentrating on detailed NUTS-3 level data and providing insights into the regionalised economic impacts of border expansion inside the Union.
