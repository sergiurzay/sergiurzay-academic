Welcome! I'm Sergi Urzay-Gómez, a Lecturer at the Faculty of Economic and Social Sciences at the Universitat Internacional de Catalunya. I earned my PhD in Economics from the Universitat de Girona in 2024, and my research focuses on Political Economy and Applied Economics, with a special interest in uncovering the profound effects of European integration on individual preferences. In addition to my role here, I also teach at the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya and serve as a Teaching Assistant at the Institut Barcelona d'Estudis Internacionals (IBEI-UPF).
