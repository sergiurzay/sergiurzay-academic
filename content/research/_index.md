## Research Interests

My research primarily delves into the intricate field of **Political Economy** with a special emphasis on the consequences of European integration. By employing rigorous **Applied Microeconomic** methodologies, I aim to dissect and understand the profound ways in which this integration influences individual preferences.

### Political Economy

Within the realm of Political Economy, my work is focused on understanding how political institutions, processes, and economic policies interact. I am particularly interested in how these factors coalesce within the context of the European Union, influencing economic outcomes and decision-making processes on both a macro and microeconomic scale.

### Applied Microeconomics

The scope of my research extends to Applied Microeconomics where I endeavor to apply microeconomic principles to analyze real-world issues. This includes examining how individuals and organizations are affected by and respond to economic policies, especially those related to the EU's economic environment.

### European Union

The European Union stands at the heart of my research. I am fascinated by the process of European integration, its economic, social, and political impacts on member states, and how these transformations shape the preferences and choices of individuals and businesses.

My PhD research is particularly centered around unveiling the layers of European integration and its ramifications, with the ultimate goal of providing insights that can inform policy-making and contribute to a deeper academic understanding of the European economic and political landscape.
